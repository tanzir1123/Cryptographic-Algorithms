# Cryptographic-Algorithms
This repository is dedicated to the implementation of four cryptographic algorithms, encompassing both classical and modern symmetric/asymmetric techniques. The goal is to provide a comprehensive collection of algorithms for encryption, decryption, and other cryptographic operations.

# Algorithms Included:
1. **Triple DES** (Modern, Symmetric): A symmetric key algorithm based on the Data Encryption Standard (DES) cipher. It applies the DES algorithm three times to each data block, providing a stronger level of encryption.
2. **RSA** (Modern, Asymmetric): A widely-used asymmetric algorithm for secure communication. It involves the generation of public and private keys, encryption, and decryption using modular arithmetic.
3. **Hill Cipher** (Classical, Symmetric): A substitution cipher that utilizes matrix multiplication for encryption and decryption. It provides a higher level of security compared to simpler substitution ciphers.
4. **Rail Fence Cipher** (Classical, Symmetric): A transposition cipher that rearranges the plaintext by writing it in a zigzag pattern along a set of rails. It offers a basic level of security and can be easily implemented.
